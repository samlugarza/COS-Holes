    "### This code is able to take the component groups and turn it into a csv file that contains all the information about the Veeper fits. It then reduces the pandas data frame to just the fits of the galaxy and runs them through a function that returns the voigt fit and the velocities associated with them to make voigt species plots similar to those seen in Figure 3 of Werk et al. 2013 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/204/2/17/pdf)\n",
