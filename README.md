# COS-Holes
How does the CGM, in conjunction with feedback from SMBHs, mediate galaxy evolution?

How does SMBH growth affect the mass and physical state of the surrounding CGM? Do galaxies with similar stellar masses, but hosting differing SMBHs show different CGM metal contents at 25-130 kpc? Do metal-line kinematics show the imprints of recent AGN-driven outflows around more massive SMBHs? Do galaxies with higher BH masses show fewer and/or weaker metal lines indicating a more evacuated CGM? Even if stars are forming today, does a galaxy with a SMBH have a more evacuated CGM? Are the velocity centroids or widths of the absorption features correlated with any of the galaxy properties we can measure (rotation velocity, BH mass)?
